  At 57, many goals have come and gone. Ive raised two kids, Ive got 3 grandchildren and another on the way.  I had 77 credits at Lane Community College when I had to move.  I taught computer classes at the Senior Center for Treasure Valley Community College.  Had surgery.s...Had many things come and go...  Life is an adventure... and Im not done...
	Seems ive been waiting all my life to School online so I could work online, stay living near the woods, rivers and lakes.... My time has Arrived!    Coding... is somthing that I got a taste of when I was taking all those computer classes with those 77 credits...finding myself.    Coding I really liked,  but it wasnt avialible like it is now....We have the technology now to work from home like never before...We have technology now that makes coding very exiciting with the things we can write... we have the need for coders like never before.  Almost everything we do needs apps... and apps need us.  And now we have bootcamps like Flatiron to bring this all together for us... Its an exciting time... and so the adventure begins.....
