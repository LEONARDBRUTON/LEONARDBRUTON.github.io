This is about the adventure of my first portfolio project.  I can honestly say I wasn't ready for this yet.  When I found out that it was The CLI Data Gem Portifolio Project I had to look up what that was,  watched 3 different peoples videos, (many times).  I had to research  scrapping, API's, I watched about 5 different scrapping videos and at least 7 different API video's just to understand why we'd need them and what there good for,then how to build them, oh and we needed to learn about, Bundler and Gems, more research....

Well they don't call it bootcamp for nothing...and quitting is not what I want.   I really love doing this...working on a problem or a build and the time flys.   

I thought it would be on all the stuff we'd been learning,  which it is to an extent.   There was alot of stuff we hadn't learned ...like how to start a project that wasn't  allready a Learn downloaded lesson, ..how to use git.   And we barly touched on scrapping.  So I can honestly say the first week I was watching video after video.  I don't know about you but watching videos is not my best learning style, but I needed to learn the info. 

By the end of the week I had started the project 3 times, the 3rd idea stuck.  Then I outlined my plans, roughly...the details come later. I learned so much by doing it but I couldn't have done it alone. 

We(my cohort) we're starting to have nightly study groups that were great help, The ones finished or almost finished, helped the ones stuck, we are really working as a team well.  The ones done were getting more practice by helping with new problems and we were all getting different ideas from each other. Our lead Jen was hosting study groups 2 or 3 times daily in the last week And us students had a nightly one going.  She has gone the extra many miles and hours for us... its been great...She is a great lead.

Well I finished the hard part today.   Now i just got to polish it up, and maybe add some bells and whistles to the end.  Im also supposed to do a video for 5min and upload it to utube, this will be hard i'm an introvert, which means I don't do well in the spot light, lol .   You know like I get (brain freeze),  This ought to be interesting .... maybe it'll be funny and I can call it a comedy on coding. 

Well I want to thank my cohort study mates,  and Jenifer Pazos for there unending help and patience.  And to Flatiron School for giving me this great opportunity to better myself and the quality of life that I have.
They don't quit on us and I won't quit on them.  They really do have the best online learning program I 've ever seen! In 3 months I've learned so much. 

And the Adventure Continues......
